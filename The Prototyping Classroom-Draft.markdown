**The Prototyping Classroom in Media Studies David N. WrightDigital Cultures Lab / Douglas College**

This proposed contribution to Cinema Journal Teaching Dossier will discuss what happens when we treat the media studies classroom as a prototyping space rather than strictly as a space to theorize about the role or content of media. Picking up on emerging conversations in Digital Humanities that foreground materiality, repair, and critical making, the contribution will show how the classroom environment is influenced by the fabrication and destruction of physical media in the classroom. The intervention asks how manipulating media and making media material changes the practice of reading media in the classroom. In the prototyping classroom, media can be examined as physical objects--torn apart or rebuilt--pressuring our canonical understanding of media studies and opening new venues for insight. For instance, how does the act of repairing media reveal implications of Third World labour? How does building media in the classroom enact hierarchical structures that signalling capitalist systems or deploy a linguistic or cultural hegemony? By treating the classroom as a space for prototyping the creation and repair of media itself, we can highlight the disciplinary intersections that govern theoretical discussions while offering opportunities to discuss the implications of the materiality in media studies and the humanities.

**Tara McPherson in that intro to Popular Culture Special Issue on Media Studies and DH**

**There are a number of ongoing discussions in media studies and parallel fields, particularly the Digital Humanities, that foreground the role of materiality in a media-dominated age. This contribution adds to that conversation by suggesting that the media studies classroom deploy methodologies that are more concerned with materiality. At the same time, there is a provocation herein to think about media studies and the fields it so often draws from--English, History, Sociology, Psychology, Geography--as spaces for examining objects rather than concepts.**







Media studies and Digital Humanities (DH) work share a range of intersecting concerns. Recent discipline-wide discussions in Flow and Media Commons, as well as at the SCMS and MLA conferences, have emphasized the crossovers between the two. For this issue of the Cinema Journal Teaching Dossier, we seek contributions that bring this discussion into the classroom. How do the concerns of DH work, with its emphases on innovative scholarly architectures, multimedia components, and cross-disciplinary hybridity, speak to evolving trends in media studies pedagogy? What kinds of pedagogical practices engage and capitalize on DHâ€™s emphases on praxis and design? How can media studies practice model and promote a productive collaboration around computing in the humanities?

Possible areas of engagement/intervention include:

* co-teaching DH courses with faculty from outside the media studies discipline

* information and computer literacy through a media studies lens

* engaging critical making and computational thinking

* developing digital resources for cross-disciplinary curricula

* data-driven course design

* hacking in media studies courses

* using/designing/imagining DH tools for media studies archival research

* engaging existing media-related DH resources for assignment design (cinemetrics, timeline of historical film color, manyeyes, tableau, &tc)

* media studies students, mapping & GIS data

* digital sustainability as a foundational praxis for curriculum design

* research processes that foreground open access work

* experiments with multimedia publication

* reverse engineering the classroom
