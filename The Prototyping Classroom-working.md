**The Prototyping Classroom in Media Studies David N. WrightDigital Cultures Lab / Douglas College**

This proposed contribution to Cinema Journal Teaching Dossier will discuss what happens when we treat the media studies classroom as a prototyping space rather than strictly as a space to theorize about the role or content of media. Picking up on emerging conversations in Digital Humanities that foreground materiality, repair, and critical making, the contribution will show how the classroom environment is influenced by the fabrication and destruction of physical media in the classroom. The intervention asks how manipulating media and making media material changes the practice of reading media in the classroom. In the prototyping classroom, media can be examined as physical objects--torn apart or rebuilt--pressuring our canonical understanding of media studies and opening new venues for insight. For instance, how does the act of repairing media reveal implications of Third World labour? How does building media in the classroom enact hierarchical structures that signalling capitalist systems or deploy a linguistic or cultural hegemony? By treating the classroom as a space for prototyping the creation and repair of media itself, we can highlight the disciplinary intersections that govern theoretical discussions while offering opportunities to discuss the implications of the materiality in media studies and the humanities.  
There are a number of ongoing discussions in media studies and parallel fields, particularly the Digital Humanities, that foreground the role of materiality in a media-dominated age. This contribution adds to that conversation by suggesting that the media studies classroom deploy methodologies that are more concerned with materiality. At the same time, there is a provocation herein to think about media studies and the fields it so often draws from--English, History, Sociology, Psychology, Geography--as spaces for examining objects rather than concepts.

This contribution picks up what a lot of other people are laying down. In short, Jentery Sayers and Co. at the UVic MakerLab in the Humanities, especially the work of Nina Belovovich and Tara McPherson who, in her introduction to the *Popular Culture* special issue on Media Studies and DH, asked "that the media studies classroom deploy methodologies that are more concerned with materiality."[^1] 

Forays into the topic of Media Studies and Digital Humanities already been well-mined by a special issue of *Cinema Journal*,[^2] Hocks and Sayers et al in *Hacking the Classroom*,[^3] Parks and Starosielski in *Signal Traffic: Critical Studies of Media Infrastructures (Geopolitics of Information)*,[^4] and in recent discussions of media studies by Matthew Kirchenbaum,[^5] Lori Emerson,[^6] Nicole Starosielski,[^7] Mark Sample,[^8] and Jonathan Sterne.[^9] 

I also take as a starting point John Durham Peters' claim that "Media are not only devices of information; they are agencies of order" (Kindle Loc 47 of 9689) and that we should endeavour to teach the political implications of media as materials objects rather than simple agents of change. To summarize Leah A. Lievrouw, media studies "will be enriched by analytic frameworks and theoretical concepts that attend to the material, tangible features of technological devices and artifacts"[^11] (50) and that media studies "take the material nature of technology as seriously as [...] its social construction."[^12] (23) the I want students to see media as possessing agency, rather than as passive instigators of human change. 

Thinking about Stephen J. Jackson's "Rethinking Repair"[^13], which seems to be signalling a decisive shift in the application of DH practice in general, I came up with the following assignment: Here, you launch into an example... taking apart a computer and repairing it....

As an editorial aside: we love the way your proposal discusses a physical engagement with media objects. There are, however, some vague claims made in your abstract.  In your completed work, we invite you to explain whether this is something you've done or are doing, and to provide concrete examples in the form of worksheets, handouts, or slideshows so that other educators can benefit from your work. If possible, it would also be great to see links to or images of student work.

Details:

We ask that you submit your essay by September 7, 2015, and that you email your completed post to Leah Shafer at shafer@hws.edu<mailto:shafer@hws.edu>. Your submission should be 1300-1600 words, written in scholarly prose suitable for academic journal publication.  Any citations you include should be formatted in Chicago style.  Inclusion of links, images, and/or video (which we would love!) is encouraged as a productive use of the online publishing format.  We encourage you to check out previous issues<http://www.teachingmedia.org/cinema-journal-teaching-dossier/> to get a sense of the tone and format, but you are, of course, free to write your piece as you choose.

Media studies and Digital Humanities (DH) work share a range of intersecting concerns. Recent discipline-wide discussions in Flow and Media Commons, as well as at the SCMS and MLA conferences, have emphasized the crossovers between the two. For this issue of the Cinema Journal Teaching Dossier, we seek contributions that bring this discussion into the classroom. How do the concerns of DH work, with its emphases on innovative scholarly architectures, multimedia components, and cross-disciplinary hybridity, speak to evolving trends in media studies pedagogy? What kinds of pedagogical practices engage and capitalize on DHâ€™s emphases on praxis and design? How can media studies practice model and promote a productive collaboration around computing in the humanities?
