**The Prototyping Classroom in Media Studies David N. WrightDigital Cultures Lab / Douglas College**

This proposed contribution to Cinema Journal Teaching Dossier will discuss what happens when we treat the media studies classroom as a prototyping space rather than strictly as a space to theorize about the role or content of media. Picking up on emerging conversations in Digital Humanities that foreground materiality, repair, and critical making, the contribution will show how the classroom environment is influenced by the fabrication and destruction of physical media in the classroom. The intervention asks how manipulating media and making media material changes the practice of reading media in the classroom. In the prototyping classroom, media can be examined as physical objects--torn apart or rebuilt--pressuring our canonical understanding of media studies and opening new venues for insight. For instance, how does the act of repairing media reveal implications of Third World labour? How does building media in the classroom enact hierarchical structures that signalling capitalist systems or deploy a linguistic or cultural hegemony? By treating the classroom as a space for prototyping the creation and repair of media itself, we can highlight the disciplinary intersections that govern theoretical discussions while offering opportunities to discuss the implications of the materiality in media studies and the humanities.  
There are a number of ongoing discussions in media studies and parallel fields, particularly the Digital Humanities, that foreground the role of materiality in a media-dominated age. This contribution adds to that conversation by suggesting that the media studies classroom deploy methodologies that are more concerned with materiality. At the same time, there is a provocation herein to think about media studies and the fields it so often draws from--English, History, Sociology, Psychology, Geography--as spaces for examining objects rather than concepts.

This contribution picks up what a lot of other people are laying down. In short, I'm borrowing from and riffing off a lot of other work in my rally echoing Tara McPherson who, in her introduction to the *Popular Culture* special issue on Media Studies and DH, asked "that the media studies classroom deploy methodologies that are more concerned with materiality."[^1] 

Forays into the topic of Media Studies and Digital Humanities already been well-mined by a special issue of *Cinema Journal*,[^2] Hocks and Sayers et al in *Hacking the Classroom*,[^3] Parks and Starosielski in *Signal Traffic: Critical Studies of Media Infrastructures (Geopolitics of Information)*,[^4] and in recent discussions of media studies by Matthew Kirchenbaum,[^5] Lori Emerson,[^6] Nicole Starosielski,[^7] Mark Sample,[^8] and Jonathan Sterne.[^9] 

I also take as a starting point John Durham Peters' claim that "Media are not only devices of information; they are agencies of order" (Kindle Loc 47 of 9689) and that we should endeavour to teach the political implications of media as materials objects rather than simple agents of change. To summarize Leah A. Lievrouw, media studies "will be enriched by analytic frameworks and theoretical concepts that attend to the material, tangible features of technological devices and artifacts"[^11] (50) and that media studies "take the material nature of technology as seriously as [...] its social construction."[^12] (23) the I want students to see media as possessing agency, rather than as passive instigators of human change. 

Thinking about Stephen J. Jackson's "Rethinking Repair"[^13], which seems to be signalling a decisive shift in the application of DH practice in general, I came up with the following assignment: Here, you launch into an example... taking apart a computer and repairing it....

The proposed assignment brings students of media studies into contact with the materiality of the media they are studying. The result of this contact is a better understanding of the processes, patterns, and relationships that underly the physical production of media. 

The assignment can be completed using any disassembled media, but for this example I will focus on a tower computer console, no screen, no keyboard, no mouse--but you could add these items as you see fit for larger practices--the outcomes and deliverables scale up or down depending on the needs and confines of the space or lesson. I focus in this way because these tower consoles are usually fairly available in academic replacement cycles given their abundance in computer labs, employee desks, and general tendency toward obsolesence given their long history -- they are not new devices. The computer tower box has been around since 1995. 

The hard part of setting the assignment is the disassembly. But, this can be done with basic household tools. There's no need to be delicate. 

The disassembled box must now be re-assembled. 

1. Prompt: "Repair, reassemble, or make work this medium" - you can change the term "medium" to "object" if you want to have them discuss the problematics around naming something a medium before you know precisely what it is...
2. In the beginning, do not give the students any screwdrivers or tools. Simply let them engage with the parts as they sit, allow them to figure out what goes where and discover the limits of their agency--what can they do without tools? How does their understanding of the "outside" of the box guide their decision-making around re-assembly. 
3. As best one can, try not to interfere with any transgressions. A mash-up re-assembly should be encouraged, with a caveat I'll get to in a minute.
4. As the students reach a natural limit in how far they, bring in tools. As you do so discuss the political agency created by access to these things. How does the tool determine the process. How does access to the tools--and the education about how to use them that accompanies such gifts--determine their use value. How do the students share information, collaborating toward a solution--how are gender stereotypes activated by assertive or regressive maneuvers when it comes to repair--do the female students back off or assert themselves? Are spaces created to allow for this kind of assertiveness or do the females break off, become submissive, do the males become aggressive, who takes ownership of the tools? Who leads the process and why?

A quick look at how the process develops suggests clear connections to the theoretical discourses around media studies, from Stuart Hall's Encoding / Decoding to Audience Reception theory, political agency, hegemony, etc.

Laura Mulvy's "male gaze" as the forced gaze of technology as saviour, even if it is not. Forced to look at tech as boy app tech startup even if one is not any of these things... forced to look at women as objects of heterosexual desire even if they are homosexual men or heterosexual women. 

Stuart Hall - we "read" according to our cultural upbringing... we know what we know because we are taught it. 

We need to think about the modes behind the material production of media, not simply the effects it may or may not produce. By encouraging students to prototype new mashups, engage directly etc., we encourage these conversations. 
 


Where traditional media studies focuses on the content, history and effects of media, the prototyping classroom keys in on the materiality of media in order to approach contextual, historical, and rhetorical situations in a way that embeds those conversations in the material rather than etherial. In short, the material classroom engenders discussions around how the physical objects mediate contact between humans as objects rather than the purveyors of messages.  

The assignment begins with a disassembled computer.

Media studies and Digital Humanities (DH) work share a range of intersecting concerns. Recent discipline-wide discussions in Flow and Media Commons, as well as at the SCMS and MLA conferences, have emphasized the crossovers between the two. For this issue of the Cinema Journal Teaching Dossier, we seek contributions that bring this discussion into the classroom. How do the concerns of DH work, with its emphases on innovative scholarly architectures, multimedia components, and cross-disciplinary hybridity, speak to evolving trends in media studies pedagogy? What kinds of pedagogical practices engage and capitalize on DH’s emphases on praxis and design? How can media studies practice model and promote a productive collaboration around computing in the humanities?
