**The Prototyping Classroom in Media Studies David N. WrightDigital Cultures Lab / Douglas College**

This proposed contribution to Cinema Journal Teaching Dossier will discuss what happens when we treat the media studies classroom as a prototyping space rather than strictly as a space to theorize about the role or content of media. Picking up on emerging conversations in Digital Humanities that foreground materiality, repair, and critical making, the contribution will show how the classroom environment is influenced by the fabrication and destruction of physical media in the classroom. The intervention asks how manipulating media and making media material changes the practice of reading media in the classroom. In the prototyping classroom, media can be examined as physical objects--torn apart or rebuilt--pressuring our canonical understanding of media studies and opening new venues for insight. For instance, how does the act of repairing media reveal implications of Third World labour? How does building media in the classroom enact hierarchical structures that signalling capitalist systems or deploy a linguistic or cultural hegemony? By treating the classroom as a space for prototyping the creation and repair of media itself, we can highlight the disciplinary intersections that govern theoretical discussions while offering opportunities to discuss the implications of the materiality in media studies and the humanities.  
There are a number of ongoing discussions in media studies and parallel fields, particularly the Digital Humanities, that foreground the role of materiality in a media-dominated age. This contribution adds to that conversation by suggesting that the media studies classroom deploy methodologies that are more concerned with materiality. At the same time, there is a provocation herein to think about media studies and the fields it so often draws from--English, History, Sociology, Psychology, Geography--as spaces for examining objects rather than concepts.


Recent trends in Digital Humanities fabrication, particularly when applied to pedagogy, offer an approach to teaching media studies that treats the classroom as a prototyping space. Students are encouraged to engage directly with the materiality of media rather than concentrate only on the theoretical applications of media studies to content and socio-cultural effects. By picking up from the tailings of emerging conversations in Digital Humanities that foreground materiality, repair, and critical making, I want to argue that the fabrication and destruction of physical media in the classroom encourages interventions that force students to probe more deeply into their own assumptions about media materiality and the political, social, and economic structures that govern that materiality. In short, manipulating and repairing media challenges the traditional practice of the media studies classroom, foregrounding provocations that encourage thinking through the structures that go into physically producing media alongside conversations about the production of content and its socio-cultural effect. 


Rebuilding media objects in the classroom enacts hierarchical structures that reveal assumptions or unspoken truths about the role media play in the world as physical objects--to some extent outside the content they conduct. The structures that produce material media objects often have no direct knowledge of the applications for that media object. By treating the classroom as a space for prototyping the creation and repair of media itself, we can highlight how fabrication reveals the disciplinary intersections governing theoretical discussions while offering opportunities to discuss the implications of the role materiality plays in revealing assumptions about the objects themselves and the practices that lie behind their production. 

In this piece, I also take as a starting point John Durham Peters' claim that "Media are not only devices of information; they are agencies of order" (Kindle Loc 47 of 9689) and that we should endeavour to teach the political implications of media as material objects rather than as simple agents of change. To summarize Leah A. Lievrouw, media studies "will be enriched by analytic frameworks and theoretical concepts that attend to the material, tangible features of technological devices and artifacts"[^11].

 This contribution picks up what a lot of other people are laying down. In short, Jentery Sayers and Co. at the UVic MakerLab in the Humanities, especially the work of Nina Belovovich and Tara McPherson who, in her introduction to the *Popular Culture* special issue on Media Studies and DH, asked "that the media studies classroom deploy methodologies that are more concerned with materiality."[^1]

Conclusion or Beginning - I. "Media are civilizational ordering devices" (Peters, John Durham. The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of Elemental Media. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2015.  Kindle Loc 105 of 9689)

"Media are civilizational ordering devices" Kindle Loc 105 of 9689

"media theory is about environments and infrastructures as much as about messages and content is well rooted in a variety of intellectual traditions. /NPara/ Digital devices invite us to think of media as environmental, as part of the habitat, and not just as semiotic inputs into people's heads. This book starts from the idea that the advent of digital media returns us to fundamental and perennial problems of communication and civilization. /NPage/ So-called new media do not take us into uncharted waters: they revive the most basic problems of conjoined living in complex societies and cast the oldest troubles into relief (kindle Loc 93-105 of 9689)

"we have to rethink what we mean by meaning. If we mean mental content intentionally designed to say somethign to someone" or "if we mean repositories of readable data and processes that sustain and enable existence" (Loc 93 of 9689) 

"Media [...] are about humans, and more specifically about vehicles that mark human meaning and intention" (Kindle Loc 80 of 9689). Thinking about the medium of the 3D printer as a "that marks human meaning and intention" allows us to see how the object it produces can have within it both meaning and intention--the intention may not necessarily be visible and it may also me offensive... if the intention is locked up in socio-cultural assumptions. If we *intend* to be racist we do not necessarily intend to be offensive. It's a wierd situation in which the object holds its intentionality through its need to be reproduced. Who makes the decision to reproduce the object and why? These are things that the fabricated object brings forward, particularly on a personal level of the individual hobbiest. 

[WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? INDIVIDUALS OR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCERS? BEST TO QUALIFY THAT]

3D printing like any of other medium can be understood generally as a way of communicating meaning. And in this particular instance, a way of communicating a textual or preserved meaning... a way of capturing meaning and holding it in the supposedly unbiased object or objectivity of the inert fabrication.

In so doing we destroy certain elements of communication. We destroy authenticity. We also revive the associations that the object might represent--some of those associations may be rendered inert by other forms of representation such as photographs, stories, or oral traditions all of which lack the tactility and interjection an object in space carries with it.

Media studies and Digital Humanities (DH) work share a range of intersecting concerns. Recent discipline-wide discussions in Flow and Media Commons, as well as at the SCMS and MLA conferences, have emphasized the crossovers between the two. For this issue of the Cinema Journal Teaching Dossier, we seek contributions that bring this discussion into the classroom. How do the concerns of DH work, with its emphases on innovative scholarly architectures, multimedia components, and cross-disciplinary hybridity, speak to evolving trends in media studies pedagogy? What kinds of pedagogical practices engage and capitalize on DH’s emphases on praxis and design? How can media studies practice model and promote a productive collaboration around computing in the humanities?

Possible areas of engagement/intervention include:

* co-teaching DH courses with faculty from outside the media studies discipline

* information and computer literacy through a media studies lens

* engaging critical making and computational thinking

* developing digital resources for cross-disciplinary curricula

* data-driven course design

* hacking in media studies courses

* using/designing/imagining DH tools for media studies archival research

* engaging existing media-related DH resources for assignment design (cinemetrics, timeline of historical film color, manyeyes, tableau, &tc)

* media studies students, mapping & GIS data

* digital sustainability as a foundational praxis for curriculum design

* research processes that foreground open access work

* experiments with multimedia publication

* reverse engineering the classroom

Submit a 250-word abstract for a proposed 1500-word essay, briefly describing the essay topic, and a 150-word biography to Melanie E S Kohnen (mek8@nyu.edu<mailto:mek8@nyu.edu>) and Leah Shafer (shafer@hws.edu<mailto:shafer@hws.edu>) by July 17.
